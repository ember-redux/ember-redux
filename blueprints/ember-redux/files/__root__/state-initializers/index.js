/**
 * For many Ember apps you may choose to ignore the state-initializer but
 * with a growing tendency for offline applications it is becoming increasingly
 * likely that you'll want some strategy for initializing your state.
 *
 * Initialization acts structurally in a similar way to reducers. In both instances
 * the overall state machine is broken down into discrete parts. Then each part of the
 * state tree is delegated to a separate file for processing.
 *
 * In the commented-out example we have "foo" and "bar" being initialized
 * in their own separate files.
